Then do you think the organization is more important than the lecture itself? in determining employment? that's not the reality.

I rarely get mad for more than 2 or 3 days, and usually when my boyfriend is angry it's me who tries to calm him down and act as a cushion until he cools off. The problem is, my silence a few days ago was an accumulation of things that had happened before. I consider my partner as a support system for whatever my endeavor is. I used to be able to like him because he listened to almost every gobbledygook and gibberish things I spat. Even when I scored a 2-point basket last night on a pick-up basketball game, she listened enthusiastically. But lately that trait is gone. Since earlier this year I complained to her that my child really wants to be heard, I also really like listening to anyone's story and try to be really enthusiastic while keeping eye contact. Especially my partner's stories. But the thing is... She rarely got interested in my stories. Just tell me a little bit and then come back to the topic later. ""Just shrug it off, you're the man"", for so long, yes. But lately, because I have plans to get married, I also want her to be my support system, right? It doesn't feel good to have to be a 100% listener without being heard when telling a story. Because I like to write, so sometimes I like to share my writing with him, and sometimes it's a way for me to release a stress, so sometimes I like to write on IG stories, it's a bit cryptic like that. But many ask me why but she never did. ""Why don't you just tell him directly?"" honestly already, and honestly, deep inside, there is a desire even once or twice to be understood even though through writing. Hell, it's been 6 years, can't you remember the pattern? I could even tell she's not in a good mood if the chat answers already have a certain pattern. Plus, the more I come here, the more I feel that I should take good care and love myself. In the past, it was difficult for me to stand up for things I know I deserve, now I feel more and more urgent to do so, so I feel stupid observing other things, including this case. Idk, fam.

Empty human corridor. There is only one male ringworm who sings a discordant song. He thought some women would be attracted to his pheromones, then copulate with him? Stupid cat. Two creatures of different species are unlikely to copulate. Their pheromones don't match. The cat is really stupid. He continued to hum his dissonant song, hoping for the moon to fall into his lap. The moon is actually a large rocky fragment that resulted from a stray asteroid's collision with Earth billions of years ago. The moon is an ugly rock, full of mange-like craters on the cat's body, and the moon and Earth exert gravity on each other in equilibrium. So the fact is that nobody wants the moon and the probability of the moon falling into the lap is zero. The male ringworm cat's gaze was then fixed on a room at the end of the corridor, next to the stairs. The door of the room was not closed tightly, revealing a woman with smooth skin but a slight tan, perhaps the effect of sunbathing on Pangkor Island. The lustful cat just got even more lustful after seeing the woman being alone. Think about the cat, maybe he just took a bath in the hot tub behind the hostel. Armed with the logic of a cat \[read: cats have no logic!\] the male ringworm cat entered the room. The cat then sat in front of the door of the room, like a sphinx, and stared at the woman intently. The woman with smooth but slightly tanned skin responded to the cat's gaze. Like this, usually when an animal and a human make eye contact, the first to look away is the animal, because they usually feel threatened by the human gaze. But not the male mange cat. Yes, as a side note, the cat is black. They looked at each other for a long time. It's raining outside. It sounds like Japanese people playing go. Then the girl was hysterical. As if possessed by a ghost, he howled, whimpering. Loud and loud. He then saw an apple peeling knife on his desk and he knew he had to do it that night. The woman came out, with a swagger and went from room to room. The screams of the other girls got louder. Blood began to flow down the drains of the dormitory, mixing with rainwater. More and more blood, screams-getting slower. Finally the dormitory was quiet again, as usual. From the last room, a woman with smooth skin came out. Now his skin is no longer smooth.

Entering class usually discusses something that leads to that first, learns little instead. He once told me that he once taught at a high school in Cempaka Putih and found a student who had difficulty having periods or something like that and *somehow* he helped the student to menstruate and become an adult *with my own way.* Then at the beginning of semester 2 and I became class president through a coup d'√©tat, there were 2 new students entering second grade, both girls. IIRC one was skinny flat chested, the other looked a bit full and busty. That's when I sent 2 new girls I entered the class and met him immediately and asked him what your name was, etc. It was quite normal until he saw his name on the nametag where it was located on the chest. The busty one was held by him until he was holding a ball or smth which was flat chested when he held him he said ""where? how come the nametag doesn't make sense?"" he also made some strange statements about religion, like if for example you jerked off right after Suhoor during Ramadan and kept calling to prayer and you already have pre-cum, it's better to just keep going because it's redundant and you can still fast (tf dude?) in the end when I'm in class 2. He was transferred to another school because of rumors that a 3rd grader was locked up in the toilet and groped his underwear when I was in 3rd grade. He somehow made a return visit to my junior high school and the male students were greeted like literally heroes coming home from war from the 2nd floor to the memes ofc.

Yes, it's the thief's fault, but to prevent the theft from happening again, the store here will upgrade the store's security system [that's what I'm focusing on. if those who study and teach religious knowledge fail, how can they make religion a regret. the way you look at this issue is wrong. non-Muslims are not an issue in Malaysia, but Muslims are. ] There are many schools that molest students, should the whole school be closed? There are many police officers who are corrupt, should the police institution be closed? The ustaz should be punished, and the selection of other teachers should be tightened and continue as usual, add more cctv to ensure the safety of students. In conclusion, all laws and education need to be towards Islamic values, you can't do it all at once, you can do it a little at a time. But the reality now is that Malaysia is becoming more secular, and religious values are disappearing, see what happens to Christians in Europe, the same thing may happen to Muslims in Malaysia",1,Ajar_Malaysia,1652096808,09-05-2022,Malay

sample_33,"TRIBUNWOW.COM, JAKARTA - The Governor of DKI Jakarta, who is also the Candidate for Governor of DKI Jakarta (cagub) for the 2017-2022 period, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama or Ahok, was suddenly furious when the inauguration of the Mbah Priok Cemetery Park, Jalan Pasar Koja, Koja District, North Jakarta, took place , Saturday (4/3/2017). At the location of the inauguration, Ahok, who wanted to speak in front of all residents and managers, was shocked when he found out that there was a fatal mistake, in the contents of the Decree (SK) for the inauguration of the historic site, it became a Cultural Heritage. The fatal error referred to and annoyed the former East Belitung Regent, namely in the contents of the decree it was written 'Allegedly Cultural Heritage'. Ahok claimed that at a leadership meeting (rapim) some time ago, it was discussed that the sentence should be changed to read 'Protected as Cultural Heritage'. ""Wow, this isn't true. It's time for the word suspected again. I think this is Batman's trap. I changed it yesterday if there isn't another word suspected. Wow, this isn't true,"" said Ahok, irritably glaring at his entourage. According to Ahok, the word ""allegedly"" means unclear. Ahok's anger was due to a fatal error in writing the contents of the SK, which also made the community, along with the congregation and visitors to the Mbah Priok Cemetery Park, also furious. No doubt, Ahok's mistake also made all residents and administrators wonder about the fatal error in the contents of the decree. ""Find the person who deliberately changed the decree. Just kill it. Fire it, fire it! Why is Islamic history so a toy? That's impudent, Pak Ahok!"" he said. The Head of the DKI Jakarta Tourism and Culture Service (Kadis), Catur Laswanto, who is known to have held and provided the unrevised decree, could not hide his embarrassment. Trying to stand in front of residents, managers and visitors at the Mbah Priok Cemetery Park, made Catur break out in cold sweat. Seen from a distance, Catur was nodding his head while talking to Ahok, whose face was red with anger. While showing SK to Catur, Ahok immediately spoke curtly again. ""What's wrong with SK like this? It's not right to be like this,"" said Ahok angrily while hitting and occasionally touching the SK paper, in front of Catur. Ahok's emotions are unstoppable. Residents, managers and visitors alike seemed to be blushing hot, when Catur could only lower his head and nod his head when Ahok sprayed him. At that time, Chess immediately left the location and returned carrying three pieces of paper that SK knew were the real ones. Ahok shook his head and got even angrier when he found out that the original decree on the inauguration of the Mbah Priok Cemetery was still kept neatly by Catur. All residents who were present at the inauguration site were even more surprised when they saw Catur carrying the original SK. ""So that's the original (SK). Why did Pak Ahok give the SK that hasn't been revised? Do you want to trap Pak Ahok using a fake SK?"" shouted a resident who witnessed the inauguration. Ahok also shouted, ""Once you find out that something is wrong, the original comes out. I want to say that the sentence is protected and enforced as a cultural heritage site. It's impudent to still use the word allegedly like this,"" Ahok said annoyed. Ahok then crossed out the DKI Governor's SK paper, which was a fatal mistake. Ahok suddenly asked for a pen and scribbled on the SK, which the residents considered to be fake. ""Where's the pen. Here, I crossed out the wrong one,"" Ahok said annoyed, then sat back down grumbling. (WartaKota/Panji Baskhara Ramadhan)",0,indonesia,1488850607,07-03-2017,Indonesian

sample_480,"Purwokerto: Even though Purwokerto is not a cultural city / cultural center, the government immediately cleaned up the old / old / former Dutch buildings. Still, there will be attractions of its own if the old Purwokerto building is renovated, developed and repurposed, not demolished. The layout of the city is also good (Did you realize why the town square of Java must have a banyan tree and a road in the middle? There is logic and ""meaning"" behind it, you know). In fact, the construction was not a modernization of the square, but instead the layout of the square was muzzled. The architecture of the mosque next to the main square is made generic and not a mix of Javanese and modern art. The construction of the mall could have been originally placed in the south, after all, the mall would become crowded. Purwokerto originally had 2 stations. One was muzzled by Suharto for the sake of a reeee's car. This old station is going to be made into a mall. Again. facepalm. If at that time it wasn't muzzled but modernized, Purwokerto-Wonosobo is not stuck now. It can even be extended to Temanggung - Semarang by another way. It has its own attractions too. This original city is full of growth and has become the capital of Banyumas from the train. Even now, Purwokerto is still a big station and all trains stop here. But they wasted it. Purwokerto was also not separated into a municipality, but as an administrative city during the Soeharto era, it continued to be merged. Tegal is just a madya city. Now there is talk of expansion, but the plan is stupid. The expansion of the Purwokerto area in the south is too expansive (although the west, north and east expansions are correct). Banyumas itself (outside Purwokerto) wants to split into 2. This is wrong. Banyumas is not that big yet. --------- For the Banyumas district itself, local businesses are not enlarged and industrialized. Mount Slamet was originally capable of producing geothermal energy but it is not being used enough. Gerak Serayu Dam can be made into hydropower but not used. Banyumas Regency in the 2000s was too focused on Purwokerto (a side effect of Purwokerto not being separated into a municipality).",1,indonesia,1655287152,15-06-2022,Indonesian

sample_97,"Ah, this is a simplification of a concrete problem that is too complex and no one knows the practical solution. Remember when Greta Thunderberg gave a speech about the climate change emergency and what was Putin's response? Putin likes his youthful vigor but he is a political mount. Putin said something like this; Everyone wants nature to be sustainable. However, the most important thing is that all third world countries want to live a prosperous and developed life like European and Scandinavian countries. The problem is these countries have gone through the era of industrialization which spewed hundreds of millions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere and the carbon that we give to nature is far from being comparable to what they have given. The number of trees now is many times more than 100 years ago and will continue to grow. Indeed, many trees are important in overcoming climate change, but the most important thing is to reduce carbon and energy use drastically and switch to renewable energy. Yes, even then there are still many who doubt this renewable energy because apart from being expensive, you still have to mine too. That is, suppose the Government of Indonesia is concerned with nature. Reducing the use of palm oil, mining and so on. The budget is reduced, which means the Human Development Index is reduced. The contribution of carbon use will only decrease by a certain percentage. Climate change is still haunting us while our hunger and lack of literacy rates are still increasing. Because, so far what humans still know is HUMAN WELFARE DIRECTLY COMPARED TO THE EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. The biggest contribution to carbon emissions comes from our food. Starting from beef and other livestock to agriculture that uses fertilizers to produce more. The funny thing is that sending food from Argentina to Southeast Asia by container ship per can of food is far more cost-effective in carbon emissions than sending food between cities and between provinces. What does it mean? Overcoming climate change is becoming difficult because it is the responsibility of all sectors of humanity. Starting from the rich people who live hedonistically on cruise ships and jet planes to the poor who only think about their stomachs. Starting from politicians and businessmen to workers who live from day to day. Everyone wants nature to be fresh and prosperous, but no one is willing to cut the human population in half, or not eat rendang anymore, or the price of the contents goes from two thousand to ten thousand one because the CPO is reduced, or the cellphone or internet is removed because of all that. need energy and still no one knows the best energy even that superpower country. Talking about Indonesia and third world countries so they care about nature is like seeing Putri Tanjung talk about success in life. Pointless and insensitive. Now answering the OP's question. Why is Indonesian awareness of the environment still low? Because our GDP is still low. Our HDI is still low. If you look at the graph, you will find a correlation between GDP and human concern for nature. How to increase GDP and HDI? What if it's not development? Natural exploitation, infrastructure development. Building decent schools. Nutrition for babies and children so that their brains develop and are not stupid like people nowadays. So, if you read Minister Siti's words, it will make sense, especially if you read the previous speech. Deforestation cannot stop in the name of development. Actually, this is in line with the results of the world conference on climate change and nature. Siti's speech also came out a few days after the results of the conference. Compromise on third world countries also have the right to development and exploitation of nature. So, deforestation is still UNDERSTANDED right up to 2030. There is time until 2030 for Indonesia to connect small areas and increase GDP significantly so that what you want, awareness of the importance of nature, is achieved.

Besides that, for Friday... if you're taking the bus, why aren't your items stored on the bus? Check in later, go home and play like that (if you don't stay past the bus route). >2. **There is 1 person who has GERD. You can't eat late, you have to eat at 7 o'clock. I'm thinking about buying a snack box for Friday and Saturday, how about that? ** I agree for this, it's better to provide a rather heavy snack box like sponge cake, bananas also help. Don't forget besides gerd ones, also provide lots of antimo... üòÖüòÖ > 3. ** Looking for a tour guide or don't you need an event in Bedugul? Any tour guide recommendations? I think this vacation is already similar to a field trip, why not all of them lol instead of just taking selfies.** I don't think I need to use a tourguide, especially if you don't intend to study history like that... assuming at most you can only visit 3-4 places a day, if you already know Where do you want to go, it's better to save on guide costs. Bedugul is Friday right? It's close there, if it's still noon, you can go back to Tanah Lot. In that area there is also the Kipu Kebo waterfall. >4. **Group bookings for Family Room are actually more economical. But, the risk is that there are families who are combined because there are 5 beds per room. Should I go for it? Or just keep booking deluxe? Our budget is 250 thousand per pax per night, including breakfast. So, because I got a price offer for a Family Room of 1 million / night / 5 pax including breakfast at a beach resort, in my opinion that's a really good price ** How many teenagers are there sis? If you want it delicious, usually the same age can be combined like that, cousins. Love them in the family room, so their parents can also be alone. Sometimes the children are put in a separate room which is a family room, then they ask who sleeps with them... so the big ones feel good on their own too. Apart from that, another suggestion is to rent a villa with lots of rooms... as far as I know it's not that expensive for 10 people or more. Now it might be more expensive, but before the rate for a 4-room villa was only 1.7 million, it could fit 10-12 people, it's a bit remote... but it's nice because it has a private pool, breakfast, and so on. >5. **A normal beach resort or hotel?** If you focus on traveling, it's an ordinary hotel. If you are going to be careless in a hotel with your family, resort or villa. >6. **Recommendation for a friendly group lunch where the food is NOT seafood. Babi is fine. But, there must be soft and soupy food because it's hard for the simbah to chew. ** hmm, I don't know that there are many elderly people üòÖüòÖ. But mostly if you make a reservation, it's good everywhere. I forgot that there used to be a place to eat bamboo like that in Ubud, once we were 30 people so it was like renting one room alone to eat it... but really forgot what it was called. >7. **I want Sunday mass at church.

That was the second time, the first that happened a few months ago, Mas X shouted at one of his children, saying ""come on, you're a boy, you can't do that, that's a sissy, that's a sissy"". Well, as I said, the youngest son is around 4 years old, so maybe he scolded his young-adult (oldest) son? But his other son, the oldest one, is only 10 years old.... Ten. Fucking. Years. old. And he scolded the kid for not being 'manly enough'. Want to ran a little. Previously I was suspicious why this room was empty, even though it was on the first floor, near the kitchen. Rent for a month is also quite expensive for boarding students, 1.5 mil IDR. But the air conditioner was broken, the report was never responded to, the room had black mold growing even though every day the door was opened so that it was exposed to sunlight. When the ceiling, aka the atep of my bathroom, collapsed and the lights went out, Mas X even grumbled. And now I have to take a shower in the dark because the light that was installed is off again, aka the lamp that was given is used, because it only turns on for a few weeks... And they hate cats, there is a cat that I diligently feed and want to take home in August, really afraid that the cat will be killed by Mas X first, sigh... Anyway, back to their worst treat. I don't understand why people are so obsessed with marriage and having kids if they can't even control themselves. After all, the victims will be their own children. Insane parents.

Underpants that were originally worn inside ‚Äì as the name implies ‚Äì more and more people started wearing them outside. Initially a few, but more and more stylish like Superman and Batman who do wear their underwear on the outside (with pride). > Just like the superhero, more and more people are wearing underwear outside.

This regulation has been in effect since January 9, 2015 it prohibits the use of trawls and seine nets. (Read: List of Susi's Moments as a Minister.) > Chairman of the Tegal City Fishermen's Association (PNKT) Eko Susanto said that banning the use of dragnet trawlers and dragging them is tantamount to killing fishermen. According to him, around 80 percent of fishing boats on the North Coast (Pantura) of Central Java use the cantrang dogol (danish seine) fishing gear. In Article 4 paragraph 2 of Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Regulation Number 2 of 2015, dogol is one of six types of trawlers pulled by boats (boat or vessel seines). > Apart from rejecting the regulations stipulated by Minister Susi Pudjiastuti, fishermen are also urging the government to revoke Presidential Regulation Number 191 of 2014 concerning Provision, Distribution and Retail Selling Prices of fuel oil. ""This regulation also kills fishermen because it prohibits ships over 30 gross tonnage (GT) from using subsidized diesel,"" said Eko. (Read: Minister Susi Pudjiastuti Should Have Done This.) > One of the boat owners from Tegalsari Village, West Tegal District, Tambari, said that so far the government has collected a fish auction levy of 2.78 percent.

sample_567,"My opinion might be inclined because of 2 aspects, historical and genetic: **Historical**: 1. Indonesia as we know it today is a ""product"" of a completely new identity. Unlike China and India. The concept of Chinese and Indian identity has been around longer, especially in European literature, so they are more familiar with the characteristics of Chinese/Indian culture. Meanwhile, Indonesia also has a fairly *new* culture that Westerners can think of as Chinese/Indian/even Muslim Arabs. 2. Indonesia was colonized by the Dutch whose most productive colonies were in Indonesia, especially Java. Think about it, what do other ethnic groups become part of the diaspora for? One of them is because of colonization, like how Africans were taken as slaves in America, Indians became slaves in South Africa etc. They were transferred to become human workers in the gardens belonging to the occupiers. Meanwhile in Indonesia, only Javanese are ""exported"" to Suriname, while Indonesians from other islands are brought to work in Java-Sumatra. 3. Indonesia is relatively stable in recent history because it was colonized by the Dutch for 3 centuries. Compare that to China which was in chaos because of the Opium war and others. One of the driving forces for ethnic Chinese to become diaspora in the US was because they tried to try their luck after being in chaos in their own country, akin to being a ""refugee"". Even though in the end the US is also enslaved, digging mines etc. For Indonesia there is no flow of refugees like that, after all if you want to try your luck you can still go to a nearby island (Java/Sumatra) you don't need to cross continents. **Genetic**: 1. Indonesians who can speak English usually don't have an accent or can even absorb foreign accents well. So they are less identified as ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù even though abroad. 2. Indonesians can be mistaken for Chinese, Indian, and even Negro (My mother was even mistaken for a Negro by white kids in the US when she was little). So Westerners cannot differentiate between Indonesians and non-Indonesians. 3. Take a look at Indonesian mulatto children, most of them immediately lose their Indonesian elements (especially those with Caucasians).

sample_135,"Just got this from WA broadcast message *WHY PRABOWO SHOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA?* This is the answer By Asyari Usman (Senior Journalist from BBC London) - Tuesday, 6 November 2018 In this long article, I will explain why Prabowo Subianto (PS) must be president. Why Prabowo? Many suggested that they should write about the reasons for giving a mandate to Mr. PS. If you want to give a short answer, here is the answer: this country is in a critical condition, it needs a ""fully equipped"" president to overcome it. A ‚Äúfully armed‚Äù president. Complete with intelligence, honesty and firmness. Visionary. The President who donated his body and soul for the betterment of Indonesia. Prabowo Subianto fulfilled the check-list above. He has those qualifications. Plus, Prabowo has the following track record, capabilities and characters. Mr. PS is clean from corruption. Cannot be dictated. Know the problems faced by Indonesia and know what the solution is. Know anyone business bandits. Knows everyone who is greedy. And know how to deal with them if he sits as president. Prabowo is not an ambitious person seeking power, but he has the ambition to elevate the standard of living and dignity of the Indonesian people. Mr. PS already has everything if his only goal is to live in comfort, without thinking about the future of the nation and state. The wealth he has can fulfill any of his worldly desires. He doesn't need to bother walking around the village, meeting small farmers and thinking about them. If Mr. PS decides to live comfortably in Switzerland or wherever is the most comfortable and expensive place in the world, he can get it. There is no need for Mr. PS to have to face insults and insults from enemies who are not happy with him because of his political struggle to liberate Indonesia from robbery, fraud, oppression, impoverishment and large-scale poverty. Mr. PS made thousands of enemies because of his determination to save Indonesia. Because of this quality of thought and personality, we deserve to entrust the presidency to Pak Prabowo. At this time, none of the big robbers masked as businessmen, were happy about PS's struggles. None of the corrupt and rotten politicians are willing to have Pak PS sit as president. However, Mr. PS took a heavy risk to seize power because he was very angry with the robbers who colluded with the authorities. That is, executive rulers, political rulers, and conglomerate-scale business-economic rulers who have long enjoyed the fruits of their robbery and oppression. Now Pak PS feels the risk. He is despised by a consortium of corrupt rulers and business bandits. It is this evil consortium that is working to block Prabowo from running for the 2019 presidential election. Are you still asking why Prabowo is ""obliged"" to become president next year? Because Mr. PS is not so and so or so and so who is easily tricked or mugged. Who can be colluded with. He would not humble himself in front of the economic imperialist powers. He would not be able to be suppressed by any foreign power. He understood how to deal with people who had been worshiped by the lecherous consortium all along. A consortium that is only concerned with increasing personal wealth by plundering the country's natural resources. A consortium of scumbag businessmen-rulers-politicians who profit from the suffering of the people. Why Prabowo? Because America, PRC, Europe or anyone else can't control it. He will be good friends with them. Sit low, stand equal. Mutual respect. But Prabowo will not be fooled by the multi-national companies that come to this country relying on their government's political pressure. This practice will be stopped by Prabowo once he is sworn in as president. Prabowo is not a person with an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù mentality. Not lowly. Facing the greedy tycoons, he would stand tall. Facing international forums and journalists, he would not stutter, let alone gasp. If you want to see the President's palace and official residence or private residence empty of dirty lobbies for business and projects, let's seat Pak Prabowo as RI-1. If you want to see the KPK work harder with the results of the throngs of corruptors, let's vote for Prabowo as president. If you want to see Indonesia's corruption index drop drastically, Prabowo is the president. Perhaps you are not satisfied with asking, what else is Prabowo's reason for having to sit as president? If you want a long description, no problem. Because there are still many serious and critical problems in this country that have not been mentioned. Pertamina is on the verge of a big problem even though the Managing Director Arif Budiman denies this. But he acknowledged that Pertamina was under heavy pressure. The national pride airline, Garuda Indonesia, has been flying in uncertain conditions for a long time. There is a threat of bankruptcy. The employees warned that they did not want Garuda to stumble like Merpati. PLN is threatened with bankruptcy if electricity rates are not raised. The State Gas Company (PGN) is also under threat. They are looking for a loan of 11 trillion. Meanwhile, BRI issued follow-on bonds of 2.44 trillion for business development. Observers interpreted this as a harbinger of liquidity crunch. This is, among other things, the bad condition of state companies that was revealed to the public. Four of the BUMNs above are important nodes of the country's economy. Whatever the reasons for the threat of bankruptcy, it is clear that this is a picture of the performance of the regime in power. They can't wash their hands. For the people, of course, this condition cannot be allowed to continue. National leadership must be in the hands of people with capability and capacity. This is absent in a country that has a fairly high level of complexity. That is why Prabowo Subianto's presidency absolutely must be presented in the April 17 2019 presidential election. Maybe you are in doubt. Because the incumbent ruler is supported by many important and smart people. You would say this regime is not problematic. This regime is correct. If you have this kind of feeling in your mind, there is no doubt that a mirage trick is hitting many people. The mirage caused many desert caravans to die miserably. Tragic. They become victims because they believe in the falsehood that is relaying. *Prabowo Subianto came with the determination to prevent that.* *So that you will no longer be a victim of a mirage, a victim of falsehood.* #PrabowoSandi2019",0,indonesia,1547888478,19-01-2019,Indonesian
